# Assets
Summary
Assets is an open source collection of html,css and javascript codes contributed by developers across the glob and can be used by for front-end web design and development by others.

How it works
1.contributions
As mentioned above (Assets) is open source therefore free for use as per the license avilable in the which is available in the documentations available.Developers are welcome to contribute and also donate their original designs and codes which will be compiled and used as an open source framework which in turn will be used by other developers or rather the general public for front-end web design and development.
This will be done via the MUzeTech current home  website in the elements page that will showcase some of the work done by selective contributors.It is therefore necessary for every contributor to acknowledge that they are contributing their work to assets and are farmiliar with it's operation.

2.The code
For the contributions pulled and pushed by contributors are raw and unstable that is the codes are not reviewed or tested for general use.However this should not limit their reliability or genuine nature.After all the codes being offered are from other developers who have taken time to create a unique and original piece to be used by other developers.
The framework will be released in versions after every code review which will be conducted on weekly basis and verified elements will be considered and used to build the assets Framework.
Developers are expected to share documentations for their projects if available and developers can also contribute decomentations too so as to facilitate these contributions and maintanace.
 
3.Userrs
Fo rthose who will be using the codes and designs for their projects there ar etwo options where one can download the full code from the Assets github repository or visit our website where stable versions of the website will be released after every code reviews and compiations by the team incharge of maintanace.This is to ensure that stable versions are released with every angle tested and considered.

Note:THis is the first document drafted as an introduction to this project.Therefore it is not exhaustive and has not yet covered every desired angle for the project,updates will be highlighted occationally so as to cover every aspect that will establish the growth and development of the project.

4.Requirements
As any other web based framework Assets is a collection of responsive elements that designed in html,css or javascript which can be used to design a fully functional website that is either static or dynamic (front-end web design) therefore making work not only  easire for developers but also unique and beautiful.

5.Features

SEO meta tags,
Grids,
Documentations......etc

Despit the free will given to our contributors we would also like to point out that Assets is a young and independent project therefore any contributions made is expected to be original and unique in order for them to be considered for the framework.Therefore plagerism will is strongly discouraged.This is to avoid potential disagreements that may arise in the near future by existing web based frameworks.
