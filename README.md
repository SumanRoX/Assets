# Assets
Summary
Assets is an open source collection of html,css and javascript codes contributed by developers across the glob and can be used for front-end web design and development by others.

How it works
1.contributions
As mentioned above (Assets) is open source, therefore free for use as per the license provided.Developers are welcome to contribute and also donate their original designs and codes which will be compiled and used as an open source framework for usage by the the community  for front-end web design and development.
Showcasing will be done  via the MUzeTech current home  website in the elements page,which  will include some of the work done by selective contributors.It is therefore necessary for every contributor to acknowledge that they are contributing their work to (Assets) and are farmiliar with it's operation.

2.The code
For every contributions pulled and pushed by contributors one should bare in mind that the code/dist/src or the assets in general are raw and unstable that is the codes are not reviewed, tested or verified for general use.However this should not limit their reliability or genuine nature.After all the codes being offered are from other developers who have taken time to create a unique and original piece to be used by other developers.

The framework will be released in versions after every code review which will be conducted on weekly basis and verified elements will be considered and used to build the (Assets) Framework.
Developers are expected to share documentations for their projects if available and  can also contribute decomentations too ,so as to facilitate these contributions and maintanace.
 
3.Users
For those who will be using the codes and designs for their projects there are two options where one can download the full code from the (Assets' github repository) or visit our website where stable versions of the website will be released after every code review and compiations by the team incharge of maintanace.This is to ensure that stable versions are released with every angle tested and considered.

Note:This is the first document drafted as an introduction to this project.Therefore it is not exhaustive and has not yet covered every desired angle for the project,updates will be highlighted occassionally so as to detail every aspect that will establish the growth and development of the project.

4.Requirements
As any other web based framework (Assets) is a collection of responsive elements that are  designed using html,css or javascript which in turn can be used to design a fully functional website that is either static or dynamic (front-end web design) therefore making work not only  easire for developers but also unique and beautiful.

5.Features
Navigation,
hero images,
containers,
cards,
buttons,
images galleries,
SEO meta tags,
grids,
animations
Documentations......etc

Despit the free will given to our contributors we would also like to point out that (Assets) is a young and independent project therefore any contributions made is expected to be original and unique in order for them to be considered for the framework.Therefore plagarism is strongly discouraged.This is to avoid potential disagreements that may arise in the near future by existing web based frameworks.
Further information will be conveyed after each and every update and can also be found on the MuzeTech website (https://muzetech.tech) you can also email us via email (muzetech11@gmail.com) in case of any suggestions,comments or inquiries [no spams allowed].
